# Pre-interview assignment


## System description
We love lunch, but it's not easy to find the right restaurant each day. A simple tool would be nice to help us select which restaurant to visit. It should be able to add new restaurants with information such as what food they serve (chinese, swedish, pizza etc.), where the restaurant is located, and it's opening hours. A randomising function can be used to select "the restaurant of the day", but make sure we don't get the same one too often!

## Answers
* I thought this will take 8-9 hours because I have not created a API by myself before. I have write down a plan and estimate after that.
* Test code:
	* Open the PR locally in Visual Studio 2022 
	* Run the API in swagger (write swagger-ui in git)
	* Test the Post and Get methods.
* I know I spent more time then I should, it was about 9-10 hours. It not easy to do something half done and I have note setup a API before and not used swagger more than some small tests. If I have had more time I would work more on the Entity Framework part. Added a database connected and mapped the entities to each other.
Change so dayofweek was more easy to read. Maybe create a own enum.
