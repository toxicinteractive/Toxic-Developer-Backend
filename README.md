# Find_Restaurant
Summary for Find-Restaurant .
The goal is this application for user to find /select restaurants easily
I have build this  Project with  ASP.NET Core Version 7 .
Used the Entity Framework Model from database (database first approach for entity)
The Project can run on Visual studio  with SQL Server .
I have implemented so far following functions:
•	Be able to create New Restaurants with necessary information and save the data in database .
•	Able to see the restaurant list with Name, Opening hours, Dish type and next page able see more details.
•	Search Restaurant’s by Category (Swedish , Italian etc)
•	Also, able to search by writing any text 
•	Be able to Edit Restaurant Information 

For Further Development :
•	Could be Add User(Admin/ visitors)  login functionality by using  .NET Core Identity
•	Search functions could be extended;  search by location / search by Price criteria / search by Opening hours 
•	Adding Picture for the Dishes 
•	Adding Responsive Design and Content Management  to make user friendly
